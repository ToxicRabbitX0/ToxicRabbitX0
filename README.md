### 👣 Traces Are Temporary — Silence Is Permanent.

### 🚀 Instructions

1. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username in this line:

```markdown
<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YOUR_USERNAME&show_icons=true&theme=radical" />
````

2. Make a repo named **exactly** like your GitHub username.

   👉 For example, if your GitHub username is `EliteXRed`, create a repo called `EliteXRed`.

3. Paste this into the repo’s `README.md` file.

4. GitHub will auto-detect it and make it your **profile readme**.
